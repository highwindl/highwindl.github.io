# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2026-01-14

**DreamSoftware** ("we", "our") operates the **Modbus TCP Station** app. This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service on the **Google Play Store** or **Apple App Store**.

### 1. Information Collection & Usage
We do not collect any personal information directly from our users on our servers. 

However, the app allows you to store the following data locally on your device:
* **Connection Profiles** (Target IP Address, Port Number)
* **Register Configurations**
* **View Layouts**

This data is stored securely using the device's internal storage mechanisms (such as Shared Preferences on Android or UserDefaults/CoreData on iOS) and is not shared with us.

**Important:** All Modbus TCP communication data is transmitted directly between your device and the target equipment (PLC, Device). We do not have access to, nor do we store, your industrial control data or communication logs on our servers.

### 2. Specific Permissions (iOS & Android)
To function correctly as a Modbus Client, this app requires specific permissions:

* **Local Network Access (iOS):** On iOS 14 and later, the app requires permission to access devices on your local network. This is strictly necessary to establish Modbus TCP connections with your PLCs or industrial devices within the same network. We do not scan your network for any purpose other than connecting to the specific IP address you provide.

### 3. Third-Party Services
Our app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you for advertising, analytics, and payment processing purposes.

We use the following third-party services:

* **Google AdMob:** Used to display advertisements. On iOS, asking for permission to track (IDFA) may be required to deliver personalized ads. If you decline, ads will still be shown but may be less relevant.
* **Google Play Services:** Used for core app functionality on Android.
* **Google Play Billing & Apple In-App Purchase:** Used for processing In-App Purchases (Premium Upgrade). We do not store or have access to your credit card information or financial data; these are handled securely by Google and Apple respectively.

### 4. Log Data
We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app, we collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.
