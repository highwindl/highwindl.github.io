# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2026-02-25

**DreamSoftware** ("we", "our") operates the **Modbus RTU Station** app. This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service on the **Google Play Store**.

### 1. Information Collection & Usage
We do not collect any personal information directly from our users on our servers. 

However, the app allows you to store the following data locally on your device:
* **Connection Profiles** (Baud Rate, Data Bits, Stop Bits, Parity, etc.)
* **Register Configurations**
* **View Layouts**

This data is stored securely using the device's internal storage mechanisms (Shared Preferences on Android) and is not shared with us.

**Important:** All Modbus RTU communication data is transmitted directly via a physical connection (USB-to-Serial converter) between your device and the target equipment (PLC, Sensor, etc.). We do not have access to, nor do we store, your industrial control data or communication logs on our servers.

### 2. Specific Permissions (Android)
To function correctly as a Modbus RTU Master, this app requires specific permissions:

* **USB Access Permission:** The app requires permission to access the USB-to-Serial converter connected via USB OTG. This is strictly necessary to establish serial communication (RS485/232) with your industrial devices. We do not access any other USB peripherals or files on your device.

### 3. Third-Party Services
Our app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you for analytics and payment processing purposes.

We use the following third-party services:

* **Google Play Services:** Used for core app functionality and stability on Android.
* **Google Play Billing:** Used for processing In-App Purchases or the Premium Upgrade. We do not store or have access to your financial data; these are handled securely by Google.
* **Google AdMob:** (If applicable) Used to display advertisements in the free version. The Pro version provides an ad-free environment.

### 4. Log Data
We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app, we collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (if available), device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics for debugging purposes.

### 5. Children’s Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
