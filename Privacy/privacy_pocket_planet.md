# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2026-01-27

**DreamSoftware** ("we", "our") operates the **Pocket Planet** app. This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service on the **Google Play Store** or **Apple App Store**.

### 1. Information Collection & Usage
We prioritize your privacy. **We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to our own servers.** The app operates primarily in an offline, serverless environment.

The app stores the following data locally on your device:
* **Simulation Data** (Planet status, objects, star points, evolution stages)
* **App Settings** (Audio volume, Eco Mode preferences, Language settings)

This data is stored securely using the device's internal storage mechanisms (such as Shared Preferences on Android or UserDefaults/CoreData on iOS).

**Important:** Since app data is stored locally on your device, deleting the app may result in the loss of your created content unless you have enabled the cloud backup features provided by your device's operating system (e.g., iCloud Backup, Google Drive Backup).

### 2. Specific Permissions (iOS & Android)
To provide the best user experience and monetization features, this app may request specific permissions:

* **App Tracking Transparency (iOS):** On iOS 14 and later, the app may request permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites. This is used solely by **Google AdMob** to deliver personalized advertisements. You can decline this permission, and the app will still function normally (ads will be less relevant).
* **Network Access:** Required to load advertisements (Reward Ads) and to validate In-App Purchase receipts with Google/Apple servers.

### 3. Third-Party Services
Our app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you for advertising, analytics, and payment processing purposes.

We use the following third-party services:

* **Google AdMob:** Used to display advertisements (e.g., Reward Ads for opening bottles). Google may use your device's advertising ID to serve personalized ads based on your interests.
* **Google Play Services:** Used for core app functionality on Android.
* **Google Play Billing & Apple In-App Purchase:** Used for processing the "Premium Upgrade" (In-App Purchase). We do not store or have access to your credit card information or financial data; these are handled securely by Google and Apple respectively.

### 4. Log Data
We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app, we collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

### 5. Children’s Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
