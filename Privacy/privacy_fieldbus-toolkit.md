This data is stored securely using the device's internal storage mechanisms (such as Shared Preferences/SQLite on Android or UserDefaults/CoreData on iOS) and is not shared with us.

**Important:** All industrial communication data (Modbus, MQTT, TCP/UDP) is transmitted directly between your device and the target equipment. We do not have access to, nor do we store, your proprietary industrial control data on our servers.
